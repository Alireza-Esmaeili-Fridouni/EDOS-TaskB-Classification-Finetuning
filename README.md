# üè∑Ô∏è EDOS-TaskB-Classification-Finetuning

This repository contains the implementation of a **fine-tuning** for **Task B** of the [SemEval 2023 EDOS (Explainable Detection of Online Sexism)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.semeval-1.305/) challenge.  
The goal of Task B is to perform **multi-class text classification** to identify specific types of sexist content in online texts.  

This project fine-tunes the **SmolLM2-135M-Instruct** model using **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods such as **QLoRA**, **P-Tuning**, and **Prefix-Tuning**.

## üåü Motivation

Online sexism and offensive content are growing concerns on social media. Detecting and classifying such content accurately helps create safer online environments.  

Training large language models from scratch is costly, so this project uses **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** with **SmolLM2-135M-Instruct** to adapt a small, instruction-tuned model for **multi-class text classification** efficiently and effectively.

## ‚ö° Features

- **Multi-class Text Classification:** Classifies online posts into predefined categories of sexist or offensive content.  
- **PEFT Support:** Fine-tuning using **QLoRA**, **P-Tuning**, or **Prefix-Tuning** for efficient adaptation.  
- **Instruction-Tuned Base Model:** Leverages **SmolLM2-135M-Instruct** for better generalization.  
- **Dataset Integration:** Works seamlessly with **EDOS Task B** datasets (`train.csv`, `val.csv`, `test.csv`).  
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Uses **4-bit quantization** and PEFT to reduce computational cost.  
- **Customizable Prompts:** Easily modify instruction prompts for classification tasks.
